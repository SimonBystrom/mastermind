Orchestrate multiple [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) agents in parallel using tmux and git worktrees, with a Bubble Tea TUI dashboard.

Each agent runs in its own tmux window on a separate git worktree/branch, so multiple Claude instances can work on different tasks simultaneously without conflicting.

## Install

Requires **Go 1.26+**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/simonbystrom/mastermind.git
cd mastermind
make install
```

This builds the binary and installs it to `/usr/local/bin`.

## Prerequisites

| Dependency | Install |
|---|---|
| **tmux** 3.0+ | `brew install tmux` |
| **git** | `brew install git` (or via Xcode CLT) |
| **claude** | [Claude Code CLI](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) |
| **lazygit** | `brew install lazygit` |
| **jq** | `brew install jq` |

## Usage

Run inside a tmux session from any git repository:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/repo
mastermind
```

Mastermind creates a `.worktrees/` directory in your repo for worktrees, state, and logs.

### Flags

| Flag | Description |
|---|---|
| `--repo <path>` | Path to git repository (defaults to current directory) |
| `--session <name>` | tmux session name (defaults to current session) |
| `--version` | Print version and exit |
| `--init-config` | Write default config file and print its path |

## Configuration

Mastermind reads its config from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mastermind/mastermind.conf` (defaults to `~/.config/mastermind/mastermind.conf`). A default config file with all values commented out is created on first run or via `mastermind --init-config`.

The config uses TOML format:

```toml
[colors]
# Values can be hex (#rrggbb) or xterm-256 codes (0-255).
# Defaults use the Catppuccin Mocha palette.
# title          = "#cba6f7"  # Mauve
# header         = "#89b4fa"  # Blue
# selected_bg    = "#313244"  # Surface 0
# selected_fg    = "#cdd6f4"  # Text
# running        = "#89b4fa"  # Blue
# review_ready   = "#94e2d5"  # Teal

# border         = "#585b70"  # Surface 2
# separator      = "#585b70"  # Surface 2
# wizard_title   = "#cba6f7"  # Mauve
# wizard_active  = "#cba6f7"  # Mauve
# wizard_dim     = "#7f849c"  # Overlay 1
# error          = "#f38ba8"  # Red
# attention      = "#fab387"  # Peach
# logo           = "#cba6f7"  # Mauve
# previewing     = "#f5c2e7"  # Pink
# preview_banner = "#f5c2e7"  # Pink

[layout]
# dashboard_width = 55   # percentage of terminal width for left panel
# lazygit_split   = 80   # percentage for lazygit pane size

[claude]
# agent_teams        = true           # enable Claude Code agent teams
# teammate_mode      = "in-process"   # teammate mode for agent team collaboration
# skip_permissions   = false          # pass --dangerously-skip-permissions to all spawned agents
# prompt_editor      = false          # open nvim in a split pane for drafting prompts
# prompt_editor_size = 50             # percentage of window height for the prompt editor pane
```

## Features

- **Parallel agents** — run multiple Claude Code instances simultaneously, each isolated in its own git worktree and branch
- **Hybrid status monitoring** — uses Claude Code hooks for instant status updates, with tmux pane polling as a fallback. Hook events fire on tool use, permission prompts, input prompts, and session stop/end. If hook data is stale (>30s), falls back to polling pane content every 2s with SHA256 stable-content hashing
- **Statusline integration** — captures Claude Code's statusline JSON output per agent, showing model name, cost ($USD), context window usage (%), and lines added/removed directly in the dashboard
- **Branch preview** — preview an agent's uncommitted changes against its base branch without leaving the dashboard. Opens a temporary diff view in lazygit; the preview is cleaned up automatically on exit
- **Spawn wizard** — multi-step wizard to select a base branch, create or pick a branch, and name the agent, rendered side-by-side with the dashboard
- **LazyGit integration** — opens lazygit in a split pane for reviewing uncommitted changes, tracks commits made during review
- **Merge workflow** — merge agent branches back into their base branch with fast-forward or full merge, including conflict detection and resolution via lazygit
- **Sortable agent list** — cycle between sorting by ID, status priority, or duration
- **Notifications** — color-coded event feed showing agent state transitions
- **Persistence** — agent state is saved to `.worktrees/mastermind-state.json` so agents survive a mastermind restart (recovered if their tmux windows still exist)
- **Dead agent cleanup** — detect and clean up agents whose tmux windows or worktrees have disappeared, or whose branches have already been merged
- **Agent teams** — optionally enable Claude Code agent teams so each spawned agent can use Claude's native team/task coordination (configured via `[claude]` in config)
- **Fully configurable** — TOML config with 25 customizable color slots (defaults to Catppuccin Mocha), layout sizing options, and Claude agent behavior settings

## Agent Lifecycle

```
running → waiting (permission/input)
    ↓
review ready → reviewing (lazygit open) → reviewed (commits made)
    ↓               ↓                          ↓
   done        previewing                  merge → conflicts → resolve → done
                                             ↓
                                            done
```

| Status | Description |
|---|---|
| **running** | Claude Code is actively working |
| **waiting** | Agent needs permission approval or user input |
| **attention?** | Agent may need attention (stable but unrecognized state) |
| **review ready** | Agent finished with uncommitted changes |
| **reviewing** | LazyGit is open for review |
| **previewing** | Branch diff preview is active against base branch |
| **reviewed** | Review completed, new commits were made |
| **conflicts** | Merge conflicts detected, needs resolution |
| **orphaned** | Agent worktree exists but tmux window is gone (can be resumed with `r`) |
| **dismissed** | Agent was manually dismissed |
| **done** | Agent finished with no pending changes |

## How It Works

1. **Spawn** — the spawn wizard walks you through picking a base branch, creating a new branch (or selecting an existing one), and optionally naming the agent. A git worktree is created and Claude Code is launched in a new tmux window. Mastermind automatically writes Claude Code hook files (`.claude/settings.local.json` and `.claude/hooks/mastermind-status.sh`) into each worktree so agents report their status via lifecycle hooks.
2. **Monitor** — a hybrid approach is used for status detection. Claude Code hooks fire on tool use, permission/input prompts, and session events, writing a `.mastermind-status` JSON file with the current state and timestamp. If hook data is stale (>30s), mastermind falls back to polling tmux pane content every 2s with SHA256 content hashing and pattern matching.
3. **Review** — when an agent finishes with uncommitted changes, its status becomes "review ready". Pressing `enter` opens lazygit in a split pane. Mastermind tracks the pre-review commit hash and detects whether new commits were made during review. You can also press `p` to preview changes against the base branch without entering a full review.
4. **Merge** — after review, press `m` to merge the agent branch into its base. Fast-forward is used when possible. If merge conflicts occur, lazygit reopens for manual resolution; mastermind monitors and completes the merge once conflicts are resolved.
5. **Dismiss** — tears down the tmux window, removes the worktree, optionally deletes the branch.

Agent state is persisted to `.worktrees/mastermind-state.json` and agents are recovered on restart. Logs are written to `.worktrees/mastermind.log`. Claude Code's statusline output is captured to `.claude-status.json` per worktree, providing live cost, model, and context usage data in the dashboard.
